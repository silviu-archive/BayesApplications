# BayesApplications
Initial application(s) of bayesian inference

Currently in research stage from the following sources:

Bayesian Data Analysis - A. Gelman et al.

Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning - D. Barber

Think Bayes - A. B. Downey

Doing Bayesian Data Analysis - J. R. Kruschke

As I will go through the reading list, I will update any relevant applications on here.

Python projects in here are not my own work, and they represent adaptations after other tutorials, with additional comments for my understanding.
