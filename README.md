# BayesApplications
Initial application(s) of bayesian inference

Currently in research stage from the following sources:

Bayesian Data Analysis - A. Gelman et al. /n
Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning - D. Barber
Think Bayes - A. B. Downey
Doing Bayesian Data Analysis - J. R. Kruschke

As I will go through the reading list, I will update any relevant applications on here.
